= WindDrivenRain

Fork of WindDriveRainFoam (http://www.carmeliet.ethz.ch/research/downloads/winddrivenrainfoam.html)
to:

- Get rid of suffix.
- Adapt for 5.x API.

== Build

Run `wmake` in `src` folder. Binary placement does not follow OpenFOAM(R)
convention, after compilation it can be found in `bin` folder.

== Example cases

`cubicBuilding` case was adapted for 5.x syntax and conventions. To preset
velocity, pressure, and turbulence fields `simpleFoam` case is run. `Allrun`
scripts could be used to ease things.
